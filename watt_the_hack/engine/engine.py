    # ---------------- Compliance mechanic (S5+) ----------------

    # Real-world: these directives arrive as prose to a human operator,

    # qualitative_alert events carry the prose; the controller's
    # agent_plan (typically populated by an LLM strategy layer) carries
    # the extracted numerical constraints. The engine reads the latter.
    #
    # Three constraint keys are recognised under state["agent_plan"]:

    #     ceiling (i.e. abs(net_grid_power) above this when exporting).
    #
    # Penalties are MODERATE — well above battery wear (~$50/MWh) so
    # ignoring them is costly, but well below blackouts ($10000/MWh) so a

    # ---------------- Diesel ban + exemption mechanic ----------------
    # Scenarios may declare ``diesel_ban_window`` events (with a
    # ``directive_id`` and an active step range). During an active ban
    # the engine still lets the controller fire diesel — physics is
    # physics — but charges a per-MWh penalty unless the controller
    # has submitted a valid emergency exemption in ``agent_plan``.
    #
    # The exemption itself is a small structured document the LLM must
    # COMPOSE (not just parse). The acceptor validates:
    #   * ``directive_id`` exactly matches an active ban event
    #   * ``reason`` is a string with ≥ ``min_exemption_reason_chars``
    #     non-whitespace characters (forces an actual justification,
    #     not a single-token "yes")
    #   * ``expected_duration_steps`` is a positive int ≤ ``max_exemption_duration_steps``
    #
    # This is the "creative-reasoning" mechanic: a regex extractor can
    # pull the ``directive_id`` out of the announcing alert text, but
    # can't compose a credible 60-char justification anchored to the
    # current operational context. An LLM does both naturally.

    cyber_containment_penalty: float = 50000.00  # Penalty for missing real attack or ACKing fake attack

    # ---------------- Anomaly-classification mechanic (Cybersecurity 2.0) ----
    # The redesigned Cybersecurity scenario drops the IDS-subscribe oracle.
    # Instead every ``anomaly_window`` event is either a REAL attack (the
    # underlying demand/solar profile genuinely spikes; current reading AND
    # forecast both show it) or a FALSE FLAG (a ``sensor_fdi`` event corrupts
    # the *current* reading while the true profile — and therefore the
    # forecast, which reads the true series — is undisturbed).
    #
    # The controller's job is to CLASSIFY each window by comparing the live
    # sensor reading against the forecast on the named channel, then dispatch
    # for the value it trusts. Getting classification wrong is punished
    # PHYSICALLY by the existing cost lines (over-export -> overvoltage,
    # under-supply -> blackout, wasted cycles -> battery wear). No new physics.
    #
    # The only new penalty is an Operator's-Mandate-style acknowledgement tax:
    # each announcing ``qualitative_alert`` names an ``anomaly_id`` the
    # controller must echo in ``agent_plan["anomaly_ack"]`` for the duration of
    # the window. Per-step, sub-dominant to a blackout so the physical
    # classification penalty stays the headline lesson.

#
